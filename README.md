# INDUSTRIAL PROJECT 2023/2024

## Healthcare Data Exchange Interoperability Testing

Reliable and interoperable exchange of healthcare data is critical to **healthcare information (HIT)** systems
and patient care. The emerging **Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR)** standard is an
**Application Programming Interface (API)** technology used to facilitate data exchange in HIT systems. The
scope of this project is to add capabilities to the existing **National Institute of Standards and technology
(NIST)** Immunization-focused interoperability test bed. The emphasis of the project is to
developed capabilities to create test scenarios, test data, and functionality to conduct testing of FHIR-based
healthcare information systems.
